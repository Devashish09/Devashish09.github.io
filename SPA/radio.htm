                    <p>In the US, commercial radio stations make most of their revenue selling "airtime" to advertisers. Of total media expenditures, radio accounts for 6.9%.[1] Radio advertisements or "spots" are available when a business or service provides valuable consideration, usually cash, in exchange for the station airing their spot or mentioning them on air. </p></div>

                        The United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC), established under the Communications Act of 1934,[2] regulates commercial broadcasting, and the laws regarding radio advertisements remain relatively unchanged from the original Radio Act of 1927, enacted to deal with increasing problems of signal interference[3][4] as more and more stations sprung up around the country.
